# Favorite Lab's 
Lab 1
I feel like saying Lab 1 being something I enjoyed is boring, but It really helped set up
a foundation for what I expected to be doing and I liked the idea of having multiple parts
as time went on. It's fun to look back to see what we had to do versus what we are doing right
now and the change in difficulty and a showcase of what we have learned throughout the semester.

Lab 8, Part 2
I liked learning how to play poker through this game. I had forgotten the instructions for
a bit but once I understood it made the code easier to write. My only dislike was having the
code for A being 11 when it should've been 1. It made the process harder and it was a hard
roadblock that I personally didn't agree with.

Lab 9, Part 2
I really liked the idea of writing two programs, game and secret that also allows for the
answer to be written in a separate file. It was really fun to write and have to test out to
make sure the code was running correctly.
